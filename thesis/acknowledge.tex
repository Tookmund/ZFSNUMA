I would like to thank my advisor Jim Deverick for his invaluable guidance on this project.
Without his advice, support, and encouragement this thesis would not have been possible.\\

I would also like to thank Linus Torvalds, Christoph Lameter, Jeff Bonwick, Matt Ahrens,
and the thousands of other developers whose work has built the Linux and OpenZFS projects.
Science is built on the shoulders of giants and nowhere is that more visible than in computer science.\\
