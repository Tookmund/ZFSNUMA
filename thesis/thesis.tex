    % %% If you don't install the font into tex packages, then you will just get Computer Modern font.
    % %% How to install uarial package in Mac OS (required MacTeX, /Library/TeX/texbin in your path). *nix with TexLive should be similar. - Shanhe
    % %%   1. curl --remote-name https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
    % %%   2. sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set indent 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% The wmthesis class is based on the latex report class which
% only indents paragraphs if they immediately follow other paragraphs.  The
% dissertation lady says this is wrong.  I tend to give more credence
% to Dr. Knuth (author of TeX) on this issue, since the other way looks really
% crappy.  If you want the first line of every paragraph indented,
% uncomment the next line to include the indentfirst package. -- rem
% Not sure if this is still an option -- Ruth
% Not an issue any more, but I keep this line in case -- Shanhe
% \usepackage{indentfirst}
